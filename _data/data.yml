career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Since my childhood, I have always been passionate about automated systems, able to
      improve our quality of life in the most efficient ways. Now my passion goes deeper
      into all the challenges that start with acquiring sensory data until the very actuators'
      movements.<br>
      As a social being and for the purpose of growing and scaling businesses, I enjoy and
      nourish a healthy collaborative and interactive environment with the team goals in mind.<br>
      As I became a creator, I am looking forward to creating Software Designs based on your
      requirements. I love having an end-to-end responsibility which includes the whole software
      delivery lifecycle workflow, from getting the requirements, scribing documentation,
      designing, testing, until the validation at the end customer. If needed, I will also
      set up a team for you, running based on Agile and Scrum values.
